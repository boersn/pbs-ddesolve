Description: Routines for solving systems of delay differential equations by
   interfacing numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood , with contributions
   by Benjamin J. Cairns. These numerical routines first appeared in Simon
   Wood's `solv95' program. This package includes a vignette and a complete
   user's guide. `PBSddesolve' originally appeared on CRAN under the name
   `ddesolve'. That version is no longer supported. The current name emphasizes
   a close association with other PBS packages, particularly `PBSmodelling'.
